      <description>What is expanded widget in flutter? In Flutter, a widget is a piece of code that defines a visual element on the screen. The Expanded widget is a convenience widget that expands a child of a Row, Column, or Flex so that the child fills the available space. This is useful for creating flexible layouts that can adapt to different screen sizes. The Expanded widget takes a child widget and a flex value, which specifies the proportion of the available space that the child should occupy.</description>
