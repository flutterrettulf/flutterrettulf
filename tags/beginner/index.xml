      <description>Overview Dart is a programming language for apps on several platforms that is client-optimized. It was created by Google and is employed to create desktop, server, online, and mobile applications. Dart is a garbage-collected, object-oriented, class-based language with C-style syntax. JavaScript or native code can both be produced using Dart. It supports type inference, reified generics, abstract classes, mixins, and interfaces.
Dart also forms the foundation of Flutter . Dart provides the language and runtimes that power Flutter apps, but Dart also supports many core developer tasks like formatting, analyzing, and testing code.</description>
