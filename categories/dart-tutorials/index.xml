      <description>Asynchronous Programming in Dart Asynchronous programming is a method of writing code, that allows the program to run multiple tasks in the background without blocking the main thread. This means that the program can continue to respond to user requests, while it is waiting for the completion of a long running task.
For example, consider a mobile application that downloads a file from the internet. In a synchronous program, the program will wait for the file to download before it can respond to user requests.</description>

      <description>What are variables in Dart? If you are familiar with programming, you would be aware of variables. A variable is basically a reserved memory location to store values. In other words, a variable in a program is a name given to a memory location that can store some data.
For example, let&amp;rsquo;s say we want to store the temperature of a particular city in Celsius. In this case, we would create a variable, temperature, and store the value of 20 in it.</description>

      <description>Overview Dart is a programming language for apps on several platforms that is client-optimized. It was created by Google and is employed to create desktop, server, online, and mobile applications. Dart is a garbage-collected, object-oriented, class-based language with C-style syntax. JavaScript or native code can both be produced using Dart. It supports type inference, reified generics, abstract classes, mixins, and interfaces.
Dart also forms the foundation of Flutter . Dart provides the language and runtimes that power Flutter apps, but Dart also supports many core developer tasks like formatting, analyzing, and testing code.</description>

      <description>What are Operands &amp;amp; Operators in Dart? In mathematics, an operator is a mathematical symbol or function that indicates the operation to be done on a value or a set of values. This is similar to how an operator in programming works. An operator defines how the operands will be processed.
Consider a simple expression val3 = val1 + val2. Here, val1 and val2 are the operands, and + is the operator.</description>
